# KernelSegmentation

We need to extract properties from grains to support downstream tasks.  Essentially this is feature extraction, but the end users want intuition about the features so we can't just use the old "bag-'o-features" trick.

Let's examine a couple images:  low moisture corn, which generally has small kernels, and high moisture corn, which generally has large swollen kernels.
